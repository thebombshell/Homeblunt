# Flood Gates - A Homeblunt Setting

It has been 600 years since the industrial revolution, 400 years since the great war, 250 years since the diaspera and 50 years since the Flood Gates.

When the Star Gates were invented, and the Space Elevators built, the expectation was a new diaspera. A collossal wave of developing space industries looking for new systems to expand into. What we got instead was frontier-men escaping isolation, fleeing experimentation, fleeing rogue AI, fleeing alien plagues and invaders. The Gates did not bring us Stars, they brought us Floods.

The expanse has ground to a halt, the influx of cheap labour has seen the Apex, Miami and Deep Way Megacorps swell with wealth and power. The Planetary Authorities, are now a uniform monolith, a testament to bureaucratic policing. The Military Police, are a swarming organised presence, ensuring even the slightest conflict can become a blood bath. The Union, are gathering the misguided, and the desparate, preaching in the streets to burn the worlds until only 1 remains.

## Races

### Core Worlds

Races from the core worlds are the most welcomed, they are protected more by the PA and Maggots and generally support a return to the expanse.

#### Human

**+1 Physicality**

**+1 Intelligence**

**+1 Proficiency**

**+1 Charisma**


Bipedal, fleshy, of a spindly yet versatile frame. Humans are about as diverse in role as they are in opinion. There are more humans in every organization than any other race, sometimes even despite their lack of suitability for the crowd, there is simply no avoiding them.

#### Orc

**+2 Strength**

**+2 Proficiency**


Averaging 7 foot 6 inches, hairless, ugly and smelly. Orcs have been with humans throughout the entire expanse. While not the strongest thinkers, they are natural professionals, craftsmen, engineers, businessmen, and ofcours, they are the ideal bureau drone. Never has a creature been so excited, as an Orc denying a stranger access to basic amenities, on their failure to declare the untaxed coffin owned by their great great ancestor.

#### Groll

**-4 Strength**

**+4 Dexterity**

**+2 Intelligence**

**+2 Charisma**


Crawling on all fours or on hind legs, 4 foot fuzzy dog / rat / sub-people. Since the industrial revolution the domesticated monster races have coelesced, once diverse, like goblins, gnolls, sprites & kobolds, they are now a small and selective genetic pool. An obedient and skiddish maintinence slave, the Groll. For the most part the Groll population are "pets", despite being more intelligent, and more compassionate than the families who own them.

#### Upgrade

**+2 Physicality**

**+2 Intelligence**




### Outer Systems

Races from the outer systems are built for labour, they are repulsed by the inefficient PA and generally sympathize with The Union.

#### Pickle Jar

#### Serphie

#### Feral

### Exotics

The Exotic Races are definitively second class citizens, if citizens at all. Conflated with the problems of the Flood Gates they survive by skirting the law or flat out ignoring it. They are reliable agents for the MegaCorps, as few others are willing to give them work.
