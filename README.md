# Homeblunt - Blunt Easy Homebrew

## Introduction
Homeblunt is a tabletop Roleplaying Game with an emphasis on simple, easy to set up, flexible rules.

### Pre-Requisites

A Homeblunt game in order to run, requires a Group, a Setting and a D20.

## The Group

A Homeblunt group consists of 1 Game Master (GM) and 2 or more Players. The GM tells how events unfold and how the world reacts, the Players control 1 or more Player Characters (PC's), typically making their characters act towards a goal, or fulfilling a role, much like improv acting.

### Player Characters

A Player Character is consisted of a Name, Gender, Age and a Setting dependant Race & Affiliation. They have an inventory which should contain a minimum set of items chosen by the GM to suit the Setting. Player Characters also have a set of Skills (Physicality, Intelligence, Proficiency and Charisma) which are determined by roll and Setting dependant Sub-Skills which take copy their base skill points from their related Skill, and then are customized to fit the character.

#### Skill & Sub-Skill Rolling

To determine a characters Skills, roll 6D20, throw away the 2 lowest rolls, assign the resulting rolls to Physicality, Intelligence, Proficiency & Charisma, as you see fit.

To determine Sub-Skills, begin with the relevant Skill number. Select 4 skills to lower by 4, then select 4 skills to raise by 4.

#### Skill Checks

To resolve a skill check, allow the GM to select a relevant Skill or Sub-Skill. Roll a D20, if the roll is less than or equal to the Skill or Sub-Skill, the check is a success.

##### Critical

If a 1 is rolled the roll is a success, regardless of skill. If a 20 is rolled the roll is a failure, regardless of skill. 

##### Modifiers

The GM may add or remove a value from a skill roll to account for additional factors, such as preparedness, foolishness or environmental conditions.

The GM may also advantage or disadvantage a roll. Advantage, allowing the best of 2 rolls to be used. Disadvantage, forcing the worst of 2 rolls to be used.

## The Setting

It is the GM's job to provide a setting for the Players, this only requires a few things, a Map, Sub-Skills, Races, Affiliations and Items. It also helps to have a story, a mild history, and for the Races and Affiliations to have relationships which play off of each other. It helps to use these Races and Affiliations to motivate PC's towards a goal, even if those goals disagree with each other.

### Sub-Skills

Your setting may contain any number of Sub-Skills, thought it is recommended to contain _at least_ 4 Sub-Skills for each Skill. Physicality, Intelligence and Charisma can be considered very general, but unique to your setting, is Proficiency. Proficiency Sub-Skills relate to training and specialization relevant in your setting. A Medieval setting may choose for example Arcane, Occult, Archery & Survival, where a Sci-Fi setting may choose Energy-Weapons, Astrophysics, Robotics & Hacking.

### Races

Your setting does not need to contain multiple races, but it is advised. Races can be a means of providing capabilities to your players as a limiting choice, Harbouring team work or team conflict on role playing grounds, or simply providing a means for PC's to take on physical attributes which will allow them recognizability.

### Affiliations

Your setting is recommended to have at least 4 affiliations. Affiliations can be anything a PC may consider themselves a part of, an agent of, in the employ of, etc. Affiliations can be a Holy Inquisition, a Judicial Party, a War Band, a Hobby Group of Weed Smoking Gamers, all that matters is that it provides something from which the PC can form bonds and conflicts within the Setting.

### Items

Your setting is likely to contain any number of items, and its list is likely to grow even through small sessions. Items provide a means for mechanics to form, do you intend to pay attention to survival needs? then you will need food; do you intend to frequent combat? then you will need weapons; do you intend to cross vast distances? then you may need navigation tools, or  vehicles.

It helps to draw up a starting pool of items, the minimum requirement to survive in your setting, then to consider their rarity and price, whether there are better alternatives to these items, whether other items could expand the mechanics implied organically, and what the settings NPC's might carry instead.
